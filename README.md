# JavaScript30
## There is no formation without repetition
So, you've done a few courses and read a few books but still don't feel great about your relationship with JavaScript?

# How do you get better?
- Build things 
- Lots of things
- Build 1,000 things
- Keep it up and don't stop. Seriously.

This has always been my advice. Just put in the work and you will get better.

But, what should I build? I have no ideas! Please don't make me do another todo app.

Ideas, Eh? Here you got lots! This is JavaScript30 â€” let's build 30 things together.
