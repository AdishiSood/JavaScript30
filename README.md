# JavaScript30
### There is no formation without repetition
So, you've done a few courses and read a few books but still don't feel great about your relationship with JavaScript?

### How do you get better?
- Build things 
- Lots of things
- Build 1,000 things
- Keep it up and don't stop. Seriously.

This has always been my advice. Just put in the work and you will get better.

But, what should I build? I have no ideas! Please don't make me do another todo app.

Ideas, Eh? Here you got lots! This is JavaScript30 â€” let's build 30 things together.

### Who is this For?
Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library.

You should already know some JavaScript to start - This isn't a JavaScript 101 course. If you are new to JavaScript, or want to just get comfortable with the fundamentals

We learn by application - encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them.

We steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These things are great and often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.

These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page. If you are stuck in console.log() land, these videos are your next step. Oh, the stuff we build is really fun!
